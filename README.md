## Testing with PostgreSQL

Using the `Test::PostgreSQL`, `App::Sqitch`, `DBIx::Class`, and
`DBIx::ClassEasyFixture` perl modules to build a testing environment that is
dynamically created and destroyed with each execution. Test can be run both
serial or parallel without impacting each other.

Includes code examples to introduce creating the environment.

*NOTE* this is a code heavy talk, and there are "eye charts", reviewing the
included source code is recommended.
